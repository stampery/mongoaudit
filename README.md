<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
MongoDB’s original designers paid much more attention to performance, scalability and ease of use than to security. It is widely known that there are quite a few holes in its default configuration settings. This fact, combined with abundant lazy system adiministrators and developers, has led to what the press has called the _[MongoDB apocalypse](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/01/08/mongodb-ransomware-exists-people-bad-security/)_.
